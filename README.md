3. Launch its server https://github.com/grimmer0125/search-food-price-server then use this extension. 

## Issues and ToDo list
1. Hide the price icon of this chrome extension if the honestbee is higher. ( It is always shown for debugging purpose)
2. Add more stores supprot. such as 美福 https://www.mayfullfinefoods.com/ (but it is more compilcated than `carrefour` and needs extra work, e.g. strip `【頂級熟成原料肉】美國特選Prime冷藏翼板原料/1672g` -> 美國特選Prime冷藏翼板原料. 
3. Not only compare with Honestbee, also compare with other stores.
